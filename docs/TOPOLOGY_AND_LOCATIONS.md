# Spanish Topology and Real Estate Locations

## Formal topology

The highest level distinction between regions is called the `Comunidad Autonoma`, which consist of `Provincias` that consist of `Ayuntamientos`. 

There are also `Codigos Postales`, which have a many-to-many mapping to `Ayuntamientos`: in cities there are often multiple postcodes for one `Ayuntamiento`, and in rural areas multiple `Ayuntamientos` are covered by a single `Codigo Postal`.
